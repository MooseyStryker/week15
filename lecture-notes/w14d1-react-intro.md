# Intro to React

In Mod 3 you learned how to create basic webpages through HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. In Mod 5 we will create advanced, interactive websites through the most popular frontend library, React.

React is a library that creates your website HTML and manages its complex JavaScript state. That's all it does. React needs extension libraries if you want additional features like routing between pages.

From we will talk about how client side code, server side code, vanilla JavaScript and React interplay with each other the your development process.

## Client Side vs Server Side environments
- environments are the machine (or program or terminal) where your code is executed.
- client side means your DOM is built by running JavaScript in the viewer's Browser engine (v8 for chrome)
- server side means the static parts of the DOM was built on the host server and sent to the client pre-built. SSR sites usually load faster.
