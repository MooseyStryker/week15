# Overview of React's Class Component Syntax

Class components are considered "legacy code". The industry has moved away from this original syntax and is primarily using function-based components. If you find React classes in your company's code base, that means the code is old and has just not been converted yet (or may never be converted). New React versions have provided support for classes (backwards compatibility) and the React team does not intend to remove that support any time soon.
